# How to Play Mergel

Mergel is a puzzle game in which you place shapes to score points. Matching together
three or more of the same shape causes the shapes to "merge" together, forming
the next shape in the series. Triangles become squares, squares become pentagons, etc. The more
shapes which merge together to form a new one, the more points you earn!

Some shapes are "alive" (indicated by their eyes), and will move after every turn. If they
are unable to move, they will turn in to a regular piece (eyes go away) and won't move
any more. Shapes which are alive cannot be merged until they stop moving.

In addition to shapes, there are also Vanilla Gels. These gels start out alive, and
won't merge with other shapes. They will merge with each other, though. Three gels form
a Jelly Bean, and three Jelly Beans form a collectible.

Collectibles are shapes which can be removed from the board by tapping on them, and are worth
lots of points. You can tell that a shape is collectible because it will rock back and forth.

Wildcards will merge with two or more of any shape, even gel, as long as the shapes are not
alive. If a wildcard is placed on the board without merging, it becomes a Black Star.
